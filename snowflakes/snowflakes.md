Two snowflakes are identical if they are the same, 
if we can make them the same by moving rightward 
through one of the snowflakes (moving clockwise), 
or if we can make them the same by moving leftward 
through one of the snowflakes (moving counterclockwise).

# Input

The first line of input is an integer n, 
the number of snowflakes that weâ€™ll be processing. 
The value n will be between 1 and 100,000. 

Each of the following n lines represents one snowflake: 
  each line has six integers, where each integer is 
  at least 0 and at most 10,000,000.

# Output
Our output will be a single line of text:

If there are no identical snowflakes, output exactly 
  "No two snowflakes are alike."
If there are at least two identical snowflakes, output exactly 
  "Twin snowflakes found."

The time limit for solving the test cases is one second.
